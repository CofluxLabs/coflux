# Introduction

Coflux is an open-source workflow engine. It can be used to orchestrate and observe computational workflows, which are defined in plain Python. It aims to maximise developer productivity and be easy to try out and adopt.

It can be used to build data pipelines, coordinate background tasks, or orchestrate real-time workflows.
