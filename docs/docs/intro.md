# Introduction

Coflux is an open-source workflow engine. It can be used to orchestrate and observe computational workflows, which are defined in plain Python. It aims to maximise developer productivity and be easy to try out and adopt.

It can be used to build data pipelines, coordinate background tasks, or orchestrate real-time workflows.

## Getting started

The first section in this guide describes the steps involved in defining and running a workflow:

1. [Installing the Python package](./getting_started/install.md)
2. [Starting the server](./getting_started/server.md)
3. [Defining a workflow](./getting_started/workflows.md)
4. [Running an agent](./getting_started/agents.md)
5. [Submitting and observing a run](./getting_started/runs.md)
