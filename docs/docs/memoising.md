# Memoising

Memoising is similar to [caching](/caching), however it only applies to steps within a run, and serves a subtly different purpose. With caching, a cache hit still results in a new step entity, but the result will be shared. Memoising is more lightweight because the existing execution is referenced directly, rather than creating a new step which references the existing result.

Memoising can be used as a way of optimising runs (by sharing a result), and also to make debugging runs easier.

Enable memoising of a task with the `memo` option:

```python
@task(memo=True)
def fetch_user(user_id):
    ...
```

Memoised steps are indicated in the web UI with a pin icon.

As with caching, explicitly clicking the 're-run' button for a step will force the step to be re-run, even if it's memoised. Then subsequent memoising will use the new step execution.

If a step is manually re-run in a child environment, the memoised results will be used (but memoised results from the child environment aren't available to the parent). This follows the same rules as caching.

## For debugging

Memoising provides several benefits for debugging:

1. Memoising a task with side effects (e.g., sending a notification e-mail) means you can re-run the whole run (or part of it) without that side-effect happening.

2. Memoising slow tasks allows you to fix bugs that are occurring elsewhere in the workflow.

This is particularly useful when re-running a workflow from a production environment in a development environment (assuming the production environment is configured as an ancestor of the development environment). By liberally memo-ising tasks, specific steps can be re-run in the development environment without re-running downstream steps.

## For optimisation

Memoising can also be used as an optimisation for workflows. For example, if a resource needs to be used in multiple parts of a workflow, rather than passing around that resource, the task to fetch it can be memoised:

```python
@task(memo=True)
def fetch_user(user_id):
    ...

@task()
def send_email(user_id):
    user = fetch_user(user_id)
    ...

@task()
def send_notification(user_id):
    user = fetch_user(user_id)
    ...
```

In this case, the `fetch_user` task will only be executed once for the run, even if steps are re-run (provided the user ID doesn't change).

## Memo parameters

As with caching, by default the memoisation considers all arguments. This can be changed by specifying the individual parameters:

```python
@task(memo=["machine_id"])
def apply_configuration(machine_id, config)
    ...
```

In this case, the function to apply configuration to a machine is only run once for the specified machine, regardless of whether the configuration itself changes. This can allow you to make changes to a workflow and re-run it with (some) confidence that a new configuration won't be applied.
